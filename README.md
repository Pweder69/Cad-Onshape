Documentation for all CAD/onshape assignments that were given in Q1. should include a description of the assignments then photos/link to onshape document and then a reflection.

## Teamwork
 In this assignment we were assigned as student 1 or student 2 and we would do the task parallel accordingly as one student would work on one part of the "spinner" and another would work on another.

### Reflection
Overall this assignment was a good reintroduction to CAD and to teamwork because its such a vital part of the engineering process. Specifically it also introduced us to the first iteration of versions and branches. I think the hardest part of the assignment was understanding what was happening through the instructions and not only what the instructions were saying.

## Swing arm 
in this assignment i was tasked with creating an object from drawings and then changing the objects variables to test wether i had made it with the correct design initiations and weather the mass would be correct on the object.

### Reflection
I think the point of this assignment is to teach the student to follow the deign intents and to follow the format that shows that the changes they make are consistent with what the purpose of the object was and how in teh future we can use versions/property's to make accessability for said object easier. I think the hardest part of this assignment was the variables as any flaw in the design process would show.

## Multi Part design
This assignment was similar to the previous one as we were tasked with making an object and then creating variations of the object the difference being the fact that the changes were in the object and not a variable.

### Reflection
This assignment was a good implementation of many things but overall still similar to the previous one as its changes were the difficult part. This is so because the changes show flaws in the design process and not in the design you can have a perfect design that doesn't change because you didn't dimension something or dint use the right constraint. another implementation was the version system to split workflow as being able to change from version to version is  a nice change in the workflow.
